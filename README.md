# Brick-breaker-game
A classic Brick Breaker game built using Java with the Swing GUI toolkit for an interactive gaming experience. This is my personal project that involve the skills in game development, object-oriented programming, and graphical rendering.

# Key Features
    - Gradient background and smooth UI design.
    - Paddle and ball physics with collision detection.
    - Breakable bricks with real-time updates.
    - In-game timer (3-minute countdown).
    - Pause functionality (press ESC to pause/resume).
    - Victory and game-over conditions.
    - Background music and sound effects for gameplay immersion.
    - etc.

# Technologies Used
    - Java Swing: For GUI and game graphics.
    - Java AWT: For handling graphics and events.
    - Timer: For in-game timer and animations.
    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): For managing game components like paddle, ball, and bricks.
    - Visual Studio Code: As the development environment.
    - Git & GitHub: For version control and project collaboration.
